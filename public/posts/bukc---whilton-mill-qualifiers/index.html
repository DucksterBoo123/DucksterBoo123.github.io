        <p>After a successful test day, I was signed on to Brunel B, Brunel&rsquo;s less experienced race team.</p>
<p>This time at Whilton Mill, we were there to race. The day took to the format of a 20 minute joint practice-qualifying session and then a 25 minute race. The results from practice were discarded as soon as the first 10 minutes were up and then the lap times would begin to count towards your qualifying stint. The qualification results were used to decide the starting grid order for the race. The results from the race would then determine which class your team would qualify for, assuming you qualified for the the championship</p>
<p>My qualifying session was unimpressive with a final result of P29/30. Having practically no seat time in these karts, I found it difficult to learn and read the kart when racing.</p>
<p>Towards the end of my race, I started to notice discrepancies with the Club100 karts, discrepancies that you wouldn&rsquo;t find on other outdoor karts. These discrepancies led to issues such as drifting around corners being faster than trail-braking, faster than zero angle steering and so on. Furthermore, the other people in my session were super talented, I&rsquo;m not sure if it was an experience issue or if it was because some of them were Formula 3 drivers. There was a DTM driver from Volacano Motorsport in my session.</p>
<p>Starting the race in P29 I was aiming for the low 20s, I knew it was possible. My qualifying position was unimpressive but I had track knowledge and the defence of KMag in Miami. On the first lap, I had made up 6 positions. This was great until I overdrove and spun out at Christmas corner, putting me in last place. I pushed on and made more positions and was back up to P26. Feeling confident, I tried for another overtake however this time I was pushed out wide heading in to a corner causing me to lock up and spin. The recovery was quicker however time was running out. I managed to make two overtakes before crossing the line in P28. A net positive finishing place but well below expectations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was the second best result for our team and we were unable to qualify. In similar suit, Brunel A were unable to qualify after making huge positions for the team but ultimately losing them due to various issues.</p>
<p>Neither team qualified, this day was shit and for sure left us all feeling sore.</p>
