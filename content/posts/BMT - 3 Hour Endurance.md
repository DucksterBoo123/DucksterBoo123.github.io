title: BMT - 3 Hour Endurance @ Daytona Milton Keynes (Sodikart)
date: 2024-12-01

I raced, alongside 5 other drivers from Brunel Motorsport Team, in the final endurance race of the year held by Daytona at their Milton Keynes track.

The day took to the format of:

- One hour Practice Session
- One shot Qualifying
- Three hour Team Race 

The race was multi-class with both Rotax and Sodi karts on track; each contributing to their own standings and one overall joint standing.

The practice session was cut short due to red flag conditions following a large crash in which barriers had to be rebuilt and medical assistance was provided.

Our qualifying driver put us P8 in the Sodikart standings and P23 overall.

We finished the race P18 in the Sodikart standings and P33 overall. It was a difficult drive due to the wet weather conditions and with not many of us having much seat time (during the wet), being competitive whilst controlling the kart proved to be a challenge.

However, you only improve with experience and commitment. Definitely looking forward to the next endurance race with the team.
