title: BUKC - Whilton Mill Test

I took part in the first test day at Whilton Mill for the British Universities Karting Championship in preparation for competing with Brunel University of London for the championship later in the year.

The karts are powered by 2-Stroke Junior Rotax Max engines coupled with the BirelART rental chassis. The karts are owned by Club100 and are rented to the teams for use.  Club 100 modify the karts by fitting restrictor kits to the exhaust thus limiting the power output.

I tested in two sessions, AM and PM. The AM session was completely wet with standing water on track however the PM session brought about a dry and far grippier track.

In the first session, I finished 3rd in class and at the top of my team. In the second session I finished 5th in class and second in my team however with a much more competitive lap time, which delivered me my BUKC Race License, allowing me to partake in the main championship.

It was a good day.
