I am a 19 year old Mechanical Engineering undergrad studying at Brunel University of London.

I am interested in Motorsport, Kart Racing, Software Engineering and Music Production.

- SODI, Rotax

I am currently competing in the British Universities Karting Championship. I have prior experience: racing in the 2023 Karting Race of Remembrance 4 Hour Endurance Race, competeing in British Wrestling Association managed tournaments and playing for two school football teams (GK).

I currently hold four accolades across Kart Racing and Freestyle Wrestling.

- 2x Podiums - 1st & 2nd (Karting)
- 1x Second in Weight Class (Wrestling)
- 1x Third in Weight Class (Wrestling)

Aside from racing and working on cars, I like to spend my time playing football as a centre-back or alternatively, my old position, goalkeeper. Having spent 4 years playing keeper, switching to centre-back has been a refreshing experience.

- Sean Gelael (Team WRT | WEC)
- Valentino Rossi (Team WRT | GT3)
- Marc Marquez (Ducati | MotoGP)
